/**
 * Use std::unique_ptr for exclusive-ownership resource management.
 *
 *
 * std::unique_ptr is a small, fast, move-only smart pointer for managing resources with exclusive-ownership semantics.
 *
 * By default, resource destruction takes place via delete, but custom deleters can be specified. Stateful deleters and
 * function pointers as deleters increase the size of std::unique_ptr objects.
 *
 * Converting a std::unique_ptr to a std::shared_ptr is easy.
*/

/**
 * Default Choice for Smart Pointers:
 * std::unique_ptr should be the go-to smart pointer due to its size and performance similarities with raw pointers. It's
 * suitable for situations demanding efficient memory and processing usage.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Exclusive Ownership Semantics:
 * A std::unique_ptr exclusively owns the object it points to. Transferring a std::unique_ptr moves ownership and sets
 * the source pointer to null. Copying is not permitted to avoid dual ownership of the same resource.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Move-Only Type:
 * std::unique_ptr is a move-only type. Upon destruction, it deletes the object it points to, typically using delete.
