 *
 * Declaring a function noexcept when it won't throw exceptions is essential for accurate interface specification.

 * exception propagates out.

 * Functions with noexcept are more optimizable than those with either throw() or no specification at all.

/**
 * Caution in Declaring noexcept:
 * Declaring a function noexcept should be a long-term commitment, as changing this later can break client code or lead
 * to program termination if an exception is thrown.
 *
 * Most functions are exception-neutral and should not be declared noexcept.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Implicit noexcept in C++11:
 * By default, destructors and memory deallocation functions are noexcept.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Wide vs. Narrow Contracts:
 * Functions with wide contracts (no preconditions) that don't emit exceptions should be declared noexcept.
 *
 * Functions with narrow contracts (preconditions exist) may not be suitable for noexcept if checking for precondition
 * violations involves throwing exceptions.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Compiler Assistance:
 * Compilers typically do not help in identifying inconsistencies between function implementations and their exception
 * specifications.
