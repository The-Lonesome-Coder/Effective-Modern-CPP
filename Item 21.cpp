/**
 * Prefer std::make_unique and std::make_shared to direct use of new.

 *
 * Compared to direct use of new, make functions eliminate source code duplication, improve exception safety, and, for
 * std::make_shared and std::allocate_shared, generate code thatâ€™s smaller and faster.
 *
 * Situations where use of make functions is inappropriate include the need to specify custom deleters and a desire to
 * pass braced initializers.
 *
 * For std::shared_ptrs, additional situations where make functions may be ill-advised include:
 * (1) classes with custom memory management
 * (2) systems with memory concerns, very large objects, and std::weak_ptrs that outlive the corresponding
 *     std::shared_ptrs.

 * version of `std::make_unique` can be easily written for C++11.

/**
 * Advantages of Using Make Functions:
 * - Reduced Code Duplication: Using make functions avoids repeating the type being created, adhering

 *
 * - Exception Safety: Make functions offer better exception safety. For instance, when passing a
 *   `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr` to a function, using make functions prevents potential
 *   resource leaks that could occur with direct use of `new`.

/**
 * Efficiency of std::make_shared:

/**
 * Limitations and Special Cases:
 * - Custom Deleters and Braced Initializers: The make functions do not support custom deleters or
 *   braced initializers. In such cases, direct use of `new` with smart pointer constructors is necessary.
 *
 * - Objects with Class-Specific `new` and `delete`: For classes with their own memory allocation and
 *   deallocation routines, using make functions might not be suitable.

 * Exception-Safety with Direct Use of `new`:

 * Performance Considerations:
 * When passing a smart pointer to a function, using `std::move` can be more efficient as it avoids
